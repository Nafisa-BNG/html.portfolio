<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Nafisa, a passionate designer and creative thinker based in San Francisco. With over five years of experience in graphic design and branding, I thrive on transforming ideas into visually compelling stories.

    I’ve had the pleasure of working with a diverse range of clients, from startups to established brands, helping them elevate their identity through innovative design solutions. My approach combines a keen eye for detail with a deep understanding of user experience, ensuring that every project not only looks great but also resonates with its audience.
    
    When I’m not in front of my computer, you can find me exploring local art galleries, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or hiking the stunning trails of the Bay Area. I believe that inspiration can come from anywhere, and I love finding ways to infuse that creativity into my work.
    
    Let’s connect and see how we can bring your vision to life!
